# ECE420RFID
Project repository of the ECE420 class. We plan to implement an RFID based attendance system which would recognize different users based on their RFID card and then mark them as present. Initially, we plan to keep the list of users and their state (present/absent) locally. As a stretch goal, we may be able to store the data on the cloud.
